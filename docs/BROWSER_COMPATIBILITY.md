- **CSS `@layers`** - Chrome 99+ (not used in our codebase)

## Build Configuration

The application uses Next.js 15.4.6 with automatic transpilation for older browsers. The browserslist configuration in `.browserslistrc` ensures proper polyfills and transformations:

```
# Support for older browsers
Chrome >= 92
Firefox >= 100
Edge >= 100
Safari >= 15
iOS >= 15
```

## Testing Recommendations

When testing on Chrome 92:

1. **Core Functionality**: All album creation, editing, and playback features should work
2. **UI Components**: Radix UI components use Safari-compatible CSS that also works in Chrome 92
3. **Animations**: Framer Motion provides cross-browser compatibility
4. **Layout System**: CSS Grid and Flexbox are fully supported

## Known Limitations

### Chrome 92 Specific

- No significant limitations identified
- All core features are compatible

### General Older Browser Considerations

- Some very new CSS features may require fallbacks (already implemented)
- Performance may be slightly reduced compared to latest browsers
- Some cutting-edge features may not be available, but none are required for core functionality

## Development Notes

- The build system automatically transpiles modern JavaScript for older browsers
- CSS autoprefixer handles vendor prefixes automatically
- All critical features have been tested to work with the minimum supported versions
- Safari-specific CSS workarounds also benefit older Chrome versions

## Browser Support Policy

We aim to support browsers that:

- Are still receiving security updates
- Represent >0.5% of global usage
- Support core web standards (ES6+, CSS Grid, Flexbox)

Chrome 92+ meets all these criteria and provides a solid foundation for the application.
